> This project aims to develop a method for testing the authenticity of data in an era of abundant resources, where distinguishing between AI-generated and human-generated content is crucial. The application will harness the power of AI and be built using Vite-React, Redux Toolkit, and the AI-content-detector API from Rapid API Hub. When a content sample is provided, the application will send it to the API to determine whether it is AI-generated or not, displaying the relative probabilities of authenticity. Additionally, the application will include a feature to showcase recently viewed content using the browser's local storage
